/*Accuracy Modes:
-0: basic accuracy mode: the same accuracy for everybody. Put your desired accuracy value on Accu1 (Accu2 won't be read)
-1: random, static accuracy mode: will provide each ped with a random accuracy value, calculated between Accu1 & Accu2 values.
-2: max. and min. accuracy levels: limits the accuracy value for each ped; this will make sure the levels for each ped are between Accu1 and Accu2. If a ped's accu. level is between both values, won't be changed. If it's higher or lower, it will be set to the max. and min. values, respectively. Accu1=min. level; Accu2=max. level.
-3: max. and min., proportional accuracy levels: limits the accuracy value for each ped, being calculated proportinally from the original value, from 0 to 100. If a ped's vanilla accu=100 and you set accu1=20 and accu2=30, it'll be set to 30. Accu1=min. level; Accu2=max. level.
